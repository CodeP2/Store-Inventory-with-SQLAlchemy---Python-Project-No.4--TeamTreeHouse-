Before we start I need to explain of why I do have 2 folders in my repository the reason for that is one is an extended code with using different imports and such and the other is for purely exceed expectation.

Explaination how the code works:
- autorincrement=True used to ensure uniqe id's 


for this project code I will also be using my repository for SQL alchemy database as from where I did learned how to use said code the only difference might be using csv import instead of panda import for importing inventory.csv file to my database.
